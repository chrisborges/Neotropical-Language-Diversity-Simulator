### Neotropical Language Diversity Simulator

###### Repository for the paper "High mountains, wide rivers: mechanisms that shaped gradients of language diversity in the Neotropics".

###### The <i>Neotropical Language Diversity Simulator</i> is a spatially explicit mechanistic model that simulates how environmental, ecological and demographic mechanisms imposed by altitude, water availability, rivers and group size shaped the pre-Columbian language and phylogenetic diversity patterns found in the Neotropical realm.
